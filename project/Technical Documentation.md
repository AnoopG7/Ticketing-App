# College Ticketing System: Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for a production-grade, mobile-first ticketing system designed for college operations. The system aims to streamline communication and task management between students, parents, operations team members, and administrators, functioning as a specialized mini-Zendesk for educational institutions. The core objectives include multi-role workflows, real-time updates, and robust analytics for performance tracking.




## 2. Core App Goals and Key Features

### 2.1. Multi-Role Workflows

The system is designed to cater to distinct user roles, each with specific functionalities and access levels, mimicking the structured workflow of a mini-Zendesk. This multi-role approach ensures efficient ticket management and clear segregation of responsibilities.

*   **Students/Parents:** These users will have the ability to create new support tickets for various college-related issues, such as exam inquiries, attendance concerns, or holiday requests. A user-friendly interface will allow them to easily submit detailed requests and track the real-time progress of their tickets from submission to resolution. This self-service capability is crucial for reducing the load on the operations team and empowering users with transparency [1].

*   **Ops Team Members:** The operations team will receive tickets filtered by category, ensuring that specific issues are routed to the most appropriate personnel. For instance, exam-related tickets might go to 'person1', attendance to 'person2', and holiday requests to 'person3'. This categorization and routing mechanism, often referred to as workflow automation, is a key feature in efficient ticketing systems [2]. Ops team members will be responsible for updating ticket statuses (e.g., `open`, `in-progress`, `resolved`), adding internal notes, and communicating with students/parents. The system will provide them with customizable ticket views to manage their workload effectively [3].

*   **Admins:** Administrators will possess overarching control and visibility across all tickets. Their responsibilities include assigning and reassigning tickets to ops team members, overseeing the entire ticketing process, and monitoring team performance. The administrative interface will offer comprehensive dashboards for tracking various metrics and ensuring operational efficiency.

### 2.2. Real-Time Workflows

Real-time capabilities are paramount for a responsive and efficient ticketing system. The goal is to eliminate delays and ensure all stakeholders are immediately informed of relevant updates.

*   **Instant Ticket Updates:** Any change in a ticket's status (e.g., from `open` to `in-progress` or `resolved`) will be reflected instantly across all relevant user interfaces, regardless of the user's role. This real-time synchronization is critical for maintaining transparency and preventing miscommunication.

*   **Automated Notifications:** Students/parents and ops team members will receive immediate notifications for significant ticket events, such as status changes, new comments, or ticket assignments. These notifications will be delivered without requiring manual page refreshes, ensuring a seamless user experience. Technologies like WebSockets are commonly employed to achieve such real-time communication [4].

### 2.3. Analytics & Performance Tracking (Admin-Focused)

Robust analytics and reporting features are essential for administrators to monitor system performance, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve service delivery.

*   **Category-Wise Ticket Trends:** The system will provide insights into ticket trends based on categories (e.g., exam, attendance, holiday). This will allow administrators to identify common issues, such as 


a high percentage of exam-related queries, enabling proactive measures to address them. This aligns with the feature of reporting capabilities in ticketing systems [3].

*   **Ops Team Performance:** Administrators will be able to track individual and team performance metrics, including the number of tickets closed, average resolution time, and identification of potential bottlenecks. This data is crucial for performance evaluation and resource allocation.

*   **Weekly/Monthly Dashboards:** Comprehensive dashboards will provide a high-level overview of the system's performance over time, allowing administrators to measure efficiency and identify areas for improvement on a weekly and monthly basis.











## 3. Recommended Tech Stack for a React Native Mobile App

To build a production-grade, mobile-first ticketing system as described above, the following tech stack is recommended:

### 3.1. Frontend

- **React Native:** For cross-platform mobile app development (iOS and Android) with a single codebase.
- **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **Redux Toolkit or Zustand:** For state management, especially for handling ticket data, user roles, and real-time updates.
- **React Navigation:** For seamless navigation between screens (e.g., ticket list, ticket details, analytics dashboards).
- **NativeBase or React Native Paper:** For UI components that ensure a consistent, mobile-first design.

### 3.2. Backend

- **Node.js with Express.js:** For building RESTful APIs to handle ticket operations, user management, and analytics.
- **WebSockets (Socket.IO):** For real-time communication, enabling instant ticket updates and notifications.
- **MongoDB or PostgreSQL:** As the primary database for storing tickets, user profiles, roles, and analytics data.
- **Redis:** For caching and managing real-time notification queues.

### 3.3. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure authentication and role-based access control.
- **OAuth 2.0:** For integration with third-party identity providers if needed.

### 3.4. Analytics & Reporting

- **MongoDB Aggregations or PostgreSQL Views:** For generating category-wise ticket trends and performance metrics.
- **Chart.js or Victory Native:** For rendering analytics dashboards and visualizations within the mobile app.

### 3.5. DevOps & Deployment

- **Docker:** For containerizing backend services.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, or CircleCI):** For automated testing and deployment.
- **AWS/GCP/Azure:** For hosting backend APIs, databases, and notification services.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging or OneSignal:** For push notifications to mobile devices.

### 3.6. Other Tools

- **Sentry or Bugsnag:** For error tracking and monitoring.
- **Jest & React Native Testing Library:** For unit and integration testing.

This tech stack ensures scalability, real-time capabilities, robust analytics, and a seamless mobile-first user experience tailored for college operations.
